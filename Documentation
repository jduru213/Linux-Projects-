# Setting Up a Honeypot on Kali Linux using Pentbox

## What is a Honeypot?

A honeypot is a security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or counteract unauthorized use of information systems. It acts as a decoy to attract potential attackers and study their methods, thus providing insights into security vulnerabilities.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to deploy a honeypot on Kali Linux using the Pentbox tool. By doing so, we aim to:

- **Gather Threat Intelligence:** Understand the tactics and techniques employed by potential attackers.
- **Enhance Security Awareness:** Identify and analyze common attack patterns and vulnerabilities.
- **Evaluate Pentbox:** Explore the capabilities of Pentbox for honeypot deployment.

## Problem Solving

This project addresses the following security challenges:

- **Detection of Threats:** Traditional security measures might not always detect sophisticated attacks.
- **Understanding Attack Patterns:** Gaining insights into how attackers operate improves overall cybersecurity.
- **Security Research:** Exploring and experimenting with different security tools and techniques.

## Challenges Faced

Throughout the project, several challenges were encountered:

- **Tool Configuration:** Configuring Pentbox to simulate realistic services and responses.
- **False Positives:** Distinguishing between legitimate and malicious activities.
- **Resource Consumption:** Managing the impact of the honeypot on system resources.

## Benefits & Flaws

### Benefits:

- **Threat Intelligence:** Gain valuable insights into the methods and motivations of potential attackers.
- **Security Awareness:** Enhance understanding of security threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Tool Evaluation:** Assess the effectiveness of Pentbox as a honeypot deployment tool.

### Flaws:

- **Resource Intensive:** Running a honeypot can consume significant system resources.
- **Legal Implications:** Ensure compliance with laws and regulations regarding monitoring network traffic.

## Recommendation

### Prospective Employers:

Would I recommend this project for an employer?

- **Yes:** This project demonstrates hands-on experience in deploying and managing a honeypot, showcasing a practical understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
- **No:** If the employer is not focused on cybersecurity or does not require skills related to threat intelligence and honeypot deployment.
