# Project Overview: Setting Up a Honeypot on Kali Linux using Pentbox

Hey Cybersecurity Enthusiasts!

I'm excited to share my project on setting up a honeypot on Kali Linux using Pentbox. Let's dive into the nitty-gritty.

## What's a Honeypot?

A honeypot is a cybersecurity mechanism designed to attract and detect potential attackers. In this project, I explored setting up a virtual environment to mimic vulnerabilities and observe malicious activities.

## Project Goals

**Objective:** To evaluate the effectiveness of Pentbox as a honeypot tool and gain insights into potential attack techniques.

**Challenges Faced:**

1. **Configuration Complexity:** Configuring Pentbox for optimal performance requires understanding various parameters and settings.
  
2. **False Positives:** Distinguishing between real threats and false alarms was a critical challenge.

## Benefits & Flaws of the Project

**Benefits:**

1. **Insight into Attack Techniques:** Running the honeypot provided valuable insights into common attack patterns and methods.
  
2. **Tool Evaluation:** The project served as a practical evaluation of Pentbox's capabilities in a real-world scenario.

**Flaws:**

1. **Resource Intensive:** Running a honeypot can be resource-intensive, affecting system performance.

2. **Legal Implications:** There are legal considerations around running a honeypot, and caution must be exercised to stay within legal boundaries.

## Project Recommendations

For those looking to embark on a similar project:

- **Hands-On Learning:** The project offers hands-on experience in configuring and managing a honeypot environment.
  
- **Tool Assessment:** Gain practical insights into the strengths and limitations of Pentbox as a honeypot tool.

In conclusion, this project was a deep dive into the world of honeypots, offering a firsthand look at both the benefits and challenges of employing such a cybersecurity mechanism.
